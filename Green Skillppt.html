Today, all of us are concerned and worried about our future, both in terms of a good and luxurious 
lifestyle and our focus is on healthy lifestyle. A healthy life is only possible when the air, water, 
food is clean. This precisely means that both health (environment) and wealth are important for us 
and one cannot replace the other.

<p><font size="4">Green Economy as Biological economy that is concerned with 
    renewable energy, green buildings, clean transportation, water, waste and land management.
    This would mean that without compromising on the ecological aspects we create options that 
    promote the economy. According to UNEP (United Nations Environment Program) a green economy 
    is defined as low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive. In a green economy, growth in 
    employment and income are driven by public and private investment into such economic activities, 
    infrastructure and assets that allow reduced carbon emissions and pollution, enhanced energy and 
    resource efficiency, and prevention of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. These green 
    investments need to be enabled and supported through targeted public expenditure, policy reforms 
    and changes in taxation and regulation. The Green Economy provides a macro-economic approach 
    to sustainable economic growth with a central focus on investments, employment and skills
