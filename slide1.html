There are five basic components of a Green Economy:
<ol>
<li>
Renewable Energy: Renewable Energy is the energy produced by the renewable sources. 
Today, with the growing need of technology, continued supply of electricity is a necessity. To 
meet the demand, we need to promote alternate sources of energy such as solar, wind, 
wave energy. Switching to these renewable sources of energy will help reduce the 
catastrophic impact on environment and promote the economy to flourish.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
Green Buildings: Buildings that do not impact the environment adversely during the 
construction and use renewable energy, reduce wastage of natural resources such as water 
and manage their waste effectively are called Green Buildings. Today, there is a rising need 
for self-sustained green buildings. Promoting green buildings will not only help preserve the 
resources for future generation but will also help in economic growth.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
 Green Transport: With the advancement in technology, there are now alternates to 
conventional transportation that used to run on petrol or diesel. It is not long ago, that the 
government in India promoted Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to run the vehicles. 
Introduction of Electric Vehicles and public transport that run on electricity is playing a major 
role in furthering the sustainable development. These are not only contributing in preserving 
the air but also ensure that economy is expanding.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
Water Management: The recent crisis in the city of Cape Town, popularly known as DayZero is an alarming situation in many metropolitans across the globe. The drought like 
situation has not only given blow to the world but has affected the economy also. The only 
possible solution to this problem is to reduce the wastage of water and replenish the ground 
water levels by adopting Rain Water Harvesting Systems (RWHS) in our communities. This 
will ensure to have a society that is self-sustainable for its basic water requirement.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
 Waste Management: Any kind of waste will contribute in causing air, water and land
pollution. This also adds to wastage of resources. Our craving to buy new and discard old, 
even if it is usable is resulting in environmental degradation. Hence, it is pertinent for us to 
follow 4 Rs- REFUSE, REDUCE, REUSE, REECYCLE and 1 U Upcycle. We must incorporate to 
segregate our waste at source. The basic segregation of wet waste (biodegradable waste) 
and dry waste (all other kind of waste) in our houses and workplaces will help recycle the 
used products. The wet waste can be composted and used in the gardens while the dry 
waste may be either recycled or upcycled.
