    <font size="4">
        A stakeholder in an economy is someone who has the ability to affect or be affected by the
growth or fall of the economy. Hence, in a Green Economy, the Government (the policy maker),
the private agencies (business that will either contribute to build the green economy or get
affected because of change in policies), the people (who will be affected) are the stakeholders at
large.
        
<ol>
<li>
<b>Government -</b>In any economy government has the key role. Similarly, in green economy
also, it is the force with which the government of a nation pushes the need of greening the
economy. All units of the government are involved in one or the other way in planning,
budgeting and execution of the policies.
<br>
Some major branches of the government like Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Petroleum, Ministry of
Environment and Forest, HRD Ministry, Education Department, Ministry of Health and
wellness, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Transportation etc. have major contribution in
defining the green economy of the country or state.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
<b>Private Agencies - </b>  Private agencies have a crucial role in giving shape to the policies. If
the policies are designed but the private agencies fail to execute them as planned, it will
have a deep impact on the economy  
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>
   <B>The People -</B>The last but the most important stakeholders in a green economy are the
   people of the nation. Any economy exists because of its people. Government brings many
   policies but the success of the policies depend on how the people have adopted the change.
